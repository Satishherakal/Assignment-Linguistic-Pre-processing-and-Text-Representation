  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "1. Lowercasing\n",
    "The first step is to convert all text to lowercase. This ensures consistency because words like “Good” and “good” should be treated as the same. Lowercasing early helps other regex and normalization steps work more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Removing URLs, Product Codes, and Prices\n",
    "Next, all URLs, product codes (like “AB123”), and prices (like “$29.99”) are removed or replaced with placeholders such as <URL>, <CODE>, and <PRICE>. These elements usually do not contribute to sentiment, so removing or masking them helps the model focus on meaningful text. This step should be done before tokenization because regular expressions work best on raw text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handling Emojis and Emoticons\n",
    "Instead of removing emojis, they should be converted to textual descriptions because they carry strong emotional information. For example, 😍 can be replaced with the word “love” or “smiling_face_with_heart_eyes”. Python libraries like emoji can do this conversion automatically. Keeping this information is important for detecting positive or negative emotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Normalizing Slang and Contractions\n",
    "Customer reviews often contain slang and short forms like “gonna”, “wanna”, and “u”. These should be replaced with their full forms (“going to”, “want to”, “you”). Similarly, contractions should be expanded — for example, “don’t” becomes “do not”. This step standardizes the vocabulary and makes word embeddings or token matching more effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Tokenization\n",
    "After normalization, tokenization splits the text into words or tokens. This allows further processing like stop-word removal and lemmatization. Using a tokenizer from spaCy or NLTK is recommended because they handle punctuation and contractions well. Tokenization must occur after cleaning to avoid splitting irrelevant symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Spelling Correction\n",
    "Since user reviews often have typos (like “amazng” instead of “amazing”), a lightweight spell corrector can be applied, such as TextBlob or pyspellchecker. Correcting common spelling errors improves model accuracy since it reduces vocabulary noise. This is best done after tokenization so that correction happens at the word level.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Stop-word Removal\n",
    "Common words like “is”, “the”, and “a” usually carry little meaning for sentiment, so they can be removed. However, negation words such as “not”, “no”, and “never” must be kept because they directly affect sentiment polarity. For example, “not good” has opposite meaning to “good.” Stop-word removal should happen after tokenization and normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Lemmatization (Not Stemming)\n",
    "Lemmatization is preferred over stemming for this task. It reduces words to their base or dictionary form while keeping the correct meaning. For instance, “running” → “run” and “better” → “good.” Stemming, on the other hand, may cut words too aggressively (e.g., “lovely” → “love” but “happily” → “happi”), which can confuse the sentiment model.\n",
    "Lemmatization preserves grammatical and semantic accuracy, which is crucial for sentiment detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Punctuation and Special Character Handling\n",
    "After important words are retained, most punctuation marks and special symbols can be removed. However, exclamation marks and question marks can be kept or counted as features since they often convey intensity of emotion (e.g., “I love it!!!” is stronger than “I love it”). Thus, only truly meaningless symbols should be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Final Output or Vectorization\n",
    "Once the text is cleaned, it can be converted into tokens or vectors for machine learning models (e.g., using TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or BERT). This step uses the cleaned and normalized data for training and prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why the Order Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "The order is important because earlier steps prepare the text for later ones. Normalization must come before tokenization to ensure consistent splitting.\n",
    "Noise removal should happen before spelling correction to avoid unnecessary processing. Lemmatization comes after stop-word removal so fewer words are processed. Each step builds on the clean structure provided by the previous one."

    "Ambiguous Sentences\n",

    "“The duck is ready to eat.”\n",
    "→ “duck” can be a noun (animal) or a verb (to lower quickly).\n",

    "→ “can” can be a modal verb or noun (container); “fish” can be noun or verb.\n",

    "→ “flies” can be a verb or a noun; “like” can be a verb or a preposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "How POS Tagging Helps\n",
    "\n",
    "POS tagging assigns each word a grammatical category (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) based on context.\n",
    "It resolves ambiguity by analyzing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Surrounding words (context window)\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntactic structure (word order)\n",

    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "In “The duck is ready to eat,” the article “The” before “duck” signals noun usage, not a verb.\n",
    "\n",
    "In “They can fish,” the auxiliary “can” followed by verb “fish” shows modal + verb structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In “Time flies like an arrow,” sequence analysis identifies “flies” as a verb, not a noun.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rule-Based vs Probabilistic Tagging\n",
    "\n",
    "Rule-Based Tagging:\n",
    "Uses manually written linguistic rules (e.g., if a word follows “the,” tag it as a noun).\n",
    "Example: “The duck” → duck = noun.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic Tagging (HMM):\n",
    "Uses probabilities from training data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Which Approach Performs Better\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 1: “The duck is ready to eat.”\n",
    "→ Rule-based works well — “The” before “duck” clearly signals noun.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 2: “They can fish.”\n",
    "→ Probabilistic performs better — it learns “can fish” is a frequent verb phrase pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 3: “Time flies like an arrow.”\n",
    "→ Probabilistic (HMM) works better — uses contextual probability to infer correct tag sequence.\n",

    "Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Rule-Based: Needs many handcrafted rules; fails with unseen or irregular patterns.\n",
